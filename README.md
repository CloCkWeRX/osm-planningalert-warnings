osm-planningalert-warnings
==========================

A quick script to fetch all planning proposals in an bounding box, and (if relevant) publish an OSM note.


Roadmap:
 - Query the overpass API and see if the development application is actually in an existing building, landuse, etc. Only then, publish a note
 - Find a better way to ensure no duplicate notes are ever created
 - Dedicated account
 - Get feedback from osm dev lists
